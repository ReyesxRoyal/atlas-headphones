# atlas-headphones
## Project Objective
- The goal of this project was to implement a responsive and accessible design based on a given Figma page, to be accessible in 3 version (Desktop, Mobile, and Tablet).

## Project Description
- Atlas Headphones is a project inspired by a real-world design challenge, where we were tasked with turning a Figma desgin into a fully responsive, accessible web page.
- We implement a design from scratch using a given figma page. Once the design is implemented in both HTML and CSS, it'll have to be accessibile and responsive.
- My partner Raesean and I created 3 different model for this figma. Raesean worked on the Desktop version while I work on the tablet part of the css then we got together to work on the mobile part.
